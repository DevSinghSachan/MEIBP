DESCRIPTION
=====
This code implements the nonnegative linear-Gaussian IBP described in
Scaling the Indian Buffet Process via Submodular Maximization [1].
See [2] for background material.

See meibp_test for example usage.
Please email the author with any questions.


EXAMPLE USAGE
=====
See meibp_test.m for example usage on a simple synthetic dataset
consisting of binary latent factors with nice structure.
