=====
Maximization-Expectation Indian Buffet Process (submodular IBP)

This code implements the nonnegative linear-Gaussian IBP described in
Scaling the Indian Buffet Process via Submodular Maximization [1].
See [2] for background material.

See `meibp_test.m` for example usage on a simple synthetic dataset
consisting of binary latent factors with nice structure.
